                    <h1>About the Record</h1>
                    <p>The Record is published weekly by the students of Horace Mann School to provide the community with information and entertainment, as well as various viewpoints in the forms of editorials and opinions columns.  All editorial decisions regarding content, grammar, and layout are made by the editorial board.  The Record maintains membership in the Columbia Scholastic Press Association and National Scholastic Press Association.</p>

                    <h2>Editorials and Opinions</h2>
